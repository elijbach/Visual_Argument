For this project I intend to encourage people to recycle and engage in conservation efforts.
I want to show a comparison of an ocean full of wildlife on one side and on the other side one 
replaced with trash that mimics the ocean life seen before. This will hopefully send the message
that without taking action, in the future we will not have the wildlife that we have today.
