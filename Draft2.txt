This draft is intended to show an argument towards recycling and preserving the environment. 
The visual argument uses a comparison of an ocean full of life and one full of garbage to show the effect of pollution.
The placement of the trash is meant to symbolize how pollution destroys the environment. In future works,
I hope to add a layer of the background that is gradiented over top the other pictures to create a 3D effect. 
I also want to shade the layers better to fit into the scenery more cohesively.
